  Instance is an abstract class and every datamodel inherits from this.
</Note>

## Properties
### `Name: string`
The name of the instance inside the world. Example:
```lua
print(workspace.Part.Name) -- outputs the name which would be "Part" here.
```

### `Parent: Instance`
The parent of the instance inside the world.

## Methods 
### `GetChildren() : {Instance}`
Returns a table containing all of the children instances of this instance.

### `Destroy() : ()`
Destroys the instance from game. Do remember to NOT make use of any methods or properties after
destroying an instance! Example:
```lua
local part = workspace.Part
part:Destroy()
```

### `IsA(className: string): boolean`
Returns a boolean if the instance is of type given. For example:
```lua
local part = workspace.Part
print(part:IsA("Part")) -- will print true
```

### `FindFirstChild(childName: string, recursive: boolean = false): Instance?`
Tries to find the child with the name given in method. Example:
```lua
local part: Instance? = workspace:FindFirstChild("Part")
if not part then 
    print("Part was not found")
else 
    print("Part exists!")
end
```

### `IsDescendantOf(ancestor: Instance): boolean`
Example:
```lua
print(workspace.Part:IsDescendantOf(workspace)) -- will be true
```

### `New(classType: string): Instance` | `static`
Example:
```lua
local part = Instance.New("Part")
part.Parent = workspace
```

## Events
### `ChildAdded: Instance`
The event is fired whenever a new child is added to the instance. Example:
```lua
workspace.Part.ChildAdded:Connect(function(childAdded: Instance)
    print("Child added named: " .. childAdded.Name)
end)

local newPart: Part = Instance.New("Part")
newPart.Name = "newPart"
newPart.Parent = workspace.Part
```
This will print "Child added named: newPart"

### `ChildRemoved: Instance`
The event is fired whenever a child is no longer a child to the instance. Example:
```lua
workspace.Part.ChildRemoved:Connect(function(childRemoved: Instance)
    print("Child removed named: " .. childRemoved.Name)
end)

workspace.Part.newPart.Parent = nil
```
This will print "Child removed named: newPart"

### `AncestryChanged: ()`
The event is fired whenever a child is added or removed.
