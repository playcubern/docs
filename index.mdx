Cubern is a place where the creativity never ends. Users can customize their avatars as they want or make games! 
Cubern exposes its scripting API through [luau](https://luau.org) - a supersubset of lua. Users can make use of 
the Cubern Workshop to build games and publish them onto the platform. You can download the Cubern Workshop at 
[cubern.xyz/downloads](https://cubern.xyz/downloads). The workshop comes with a code editor with full LSP support by 
default. Hence, you dont need to download any other software. 


## About Cubern Internally
Cubern is developed with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) - an open source game engine. Cubern makes use of C# under the hood 
however we compile the project AOT hence no dotnet runtime is required.
