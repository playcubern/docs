If you've never used the **Luau programming language** before, you can read about its syntax in depth [here](https://luau.org/syntax).

Cubern exposes its objects through a **datamodel**, where every object is an `Instance`. Understanding how to reference and manipulate Instances is fundamental to scripting in Cubern.

---

## Interacting with Instances

Let’s say you have a part in the workspace that looks like a cube and is named `"Part"`. To manipulate it in your script, you need to get a reference to it.  

### Safe way: `FindFirstChild`

```lua
local myPart = workspace:FindFirstChild("Part")
````

* `FindFirstChild` searches for a child object by name.
* **Returns `nil`** if the object doesn’t exist, so it’s safer than direct indexing.

Always check if the object exists before using it to avoid runtime errors.

Example:

```lua
local myPart = workspace:FindFirstChild("Part")
if myPart then
    print("Found the part!")
else
    warn("Part not found!")
end
```

---

### Shortcut: Direct indexing

You can also reference objects using the dot operator:

```lua
local myPart = workspace.Part
```

* This is shorter, but **will throw an error** if `Part` doesn’t exist.
* Use it only when you are sure the object is present.

Use `FindFirstChild` when working with dynamic or user-created objects.

---

## Modifying Properties

Every `Instance` has properties you can read or change. For example, changing the `Name`:

```lua
local myPart = workspace.Part
myPart.Name = "MyFavouritePart"
print(myPart.Name)  -- Output: MyFavouritePart
```

* You can manipulate other properties in the same way, like `Position`, `Size`, or `Transparency`.

Changing object names may break scripts that reference the original name. Be cautious when renaming objects dynamically.

---

## Summary

* **Instance**: Every object in Cubern is an Instance.
* **FindFirstChild**: Safe method to get children by name.
* **Dot indexing**: Quick access if the object is guaranteed to exist.
* **Properties**: Read/write object properties using `.`.

---

### Next steps

Try creating a few parts and experimenting with:

* `Name`
* `Position`
* `Size`

Observe how your scripts behave with both `FindFirstChild` and dot indexing.
